	title = "Return to the Gilded Age"
	desc = "President Biden has begun to speak of the Gilded Age as if it were the present day. He has been referencing Vanderbilt, Carnegie, and Rockefeller in cabinet meetings and asked about the progress of the transcontinental railroad. Medical staff have confirmed a significant cognitive decline, but political advisors have convinced the cabinet to keep him in office while they attempt to implement policies they believe will benefit from this historical confusion."

	title = "The New Golden Spike Ceremony"
	desc = "In a bizarre ceremony today, President Biden has driven in a golden spike to commemorate the 'completion' of the transcontinental railroad revival project. While the actual infrastructure improvements were standard modernization projects, the President insisted on full 19th century regalia and repeatedly referred to the year as 1869. The carefully managed press event has actually resulted in a surprising boost to national morale, with many citizens finding the historical pageantry charming and educational."

	title = "Labor Unrest Sweeps the Nation"
	desc = "The President's confusing economic policies have led to massive labor protests across the country. Workers are organizing against what they see as a return to Gilded Age exploitation. The situation has become so severe that advisors are suggesting either brutal crackdowns using private security forces or genuine labor reforms to address the unrest."

	title = "Revival of Political Machines"
	desc = "Taking advantage of the President's confusion, various political operators have established modern versions of Tammany Hall-style political machines in major cities. These organizations distribute government jobs and contracts in exchange for political support, creating both corruption and surprising efficiency in some government operations."

	desc = "Echoing the infamous 'Corrupt Bargain' of 1824, several high-ranking officials have been caught in a complex scheme to manipulate the political system for personal gain. The President, believing this to be a normal practice of the Gilded Age, has shown little concern, causing public outrage and a political scandal."

	desc = "Inspired by the Gilded Age references constantly made by the President, a new generation of investigative journalists have begun publishing expos√©s on corruption, monopolistic practices, and government inefficiency. These modern 'muckrakers' have galvanized public opinion against the worst excesses of the administration's policies."

	title = "Yellow Journalism Makes a Comeback"
	desc = "Sensationalist media outlets have embraced the President's historical confusion, publishing increasingly jingoistic and expansionist rhetoric. Headlines demand American intervention abroad and warn of foreign threats, much like the yellow journalism of the 1890s that helped push the country toward the Spanish-American War."

	desc = "In a shocking press conference, the President ordered the Navy to prepare for war with Spain over the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor. Advisors quickly redirected this confusion into a general policy of naval readiness and military preparedness, but not before causing a diplomatic incident with Spain and raising war fervor among the public."

	desc = "In a ceremony that confused Hawaiian state officials, the President signed an 'annexation treaty' formally bringing Hawaii into the United States. When informed that Hawaii has been a state since 1959, the President insisted that the new paperwork was necessary due to 'Dole's pineapple interests' and 'Queen Liliuokalani's objections.' The bizarre event has actually renewed interest in Hawaiian history and brought attention to indigenous sovereignty issues."
